This is the first Smart Agent Improvement Proposal or "SIP 0" 

The Smart Agenet Core Improvements are designed to driven by an open review process. 
Improvements are code, prompts, functions, or plug-ins that can be included in the "internal" code of the downloadable Smart Agent Core Software.
Improvements extend the capabilities of the Smart Agent Core Software. For example, adding specific Prompts for the Smart Agent to recognize when the user requests them.
SIPs should therefore specify how to map this new prompt to cryptographically validated external Smart Contracts or APIs.

## Examples of Smart Agent Core Improvement Proposals 
- SIP #1. Prompt for connecting to wallet.
- SIP #2. Prompt for swapping / trading tokens.
- SIP #3 Prompt for Earning yield on tokens.
